# Gus Payment Processor

Gus is a solution to monetizing Chrome extensions, while allowing the developer to keep 100% of the cut, and have fine-grain control over the processing. Manage extension licenses with minimal effort.

## Gus > ExtPay

1. Gus allows you to have full control over what gets sold (and what doesn't). 
2. Gus doesn't take a cut.
3. You can see Gus' source code
4. While Gus makes you get more hands on with integration, that means you get finer control.

## Tech Stack
